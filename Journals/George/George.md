# CMPE 172 Project Journal


## Week #1 Status Report

* For this week my team and I met to discuss the project and the first tasks we could do. We also talked about our strengths and weaknesses so we could decide whho will work on the frontend and will work on the backend.

* We created columns in github to add cards:
  * To Do
  * In Progress
  * Done

* We talked about the initial tasks that we would do and created a card for each task in the To Do column.

* This week I worked on the card "Create class diagram for the drinks"

* Since this is the first week of the project, we did not face much challenges.



## Week #2 Status Report

* This week we had a meeting and we divided up what part of the project we will be working on.

* We decided that I will be working on the Cashier's app part. 

* Our group will try to use stripe instead of cybersource.

* We added more cards to the project in github.

* Progress:
	* I added the Starbucks nodeJS professor example to the repository as a starting point for the cashier's portion of the project. 

	* I have been thinking on the design for the cashier's app

	* We started working with stripe so we can integrate it to the project soon

* Challenges: 
	* Time has been a little of a challenge


## Week #3 Status Report

* This week I worked on developing the cashier's app part of the project. I created it using spring and successfully created a simple application that can be used by the cashier. The only thing i need to do is update the application UI so that it can be used on a rectangular/square screen that are used by cashiers. We also need to connect the backend to the cashier's app.

* Our group met this week to talk about our progress and coordinate when we should have the project ready to go and when we will meet to create the video that we will submit. 

* Card I worked on:

* Challenges:

	* When I first ran the application, it kept giving me an error 
		* Solution: I spent like an hour looking at the code and I noticed that I had an error in file name. The file name had a typo making it different than the class name inside the file. Fixing the name fixed the error.


## Week #4 Status Report

* This week I continued working on the Cashier's app. I changed the UI in the home scrreen to use the starbucks image as a hyperlink instead of using text to move to the next view. I also modified the ingrediesnts selection page to look more neat. This week, I fixed the UI to fit in a square/rectangular screen like the ones cashiers use. I'm also currently working on handling insufficient funds on the cards used by client.

* Our group met this week to make sure all our parts will be ready for us to submit and look if we are missing anything.

* Updated Cashier's app UI:


* Cards:
