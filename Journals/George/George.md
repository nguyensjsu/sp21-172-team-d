# CMPE 172 Project Journal


## Week #1 Status Report

* For this week my team and I met to discuss the project and the first tasks we could do. We also talked about our strengths and weaknesses so we could decide whho will work on the frontend and will work on the backend.

* We created columns in github to add cards:
  * To Do
  * In Progress
  * Done

* We talked about the initial tasks that we would do and created a card for each task in the To Do column.

* This week I worked on the card "Create class diagram for the drinks"
