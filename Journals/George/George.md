# CMPE 172 Project Journal


## Week #1 Status Report

* For this week my team and I met to discuss the project and the first tasks we could do. We also talked about our strengths and weaknesses so we could decide whho will work on the frontend and will work on the backend.

* We created columns in github to add cards:
  * To Do
  * In Progress
  * Done

* We talked about the initial tasks that we would do and created a card for each task in the To Do column.

* This week I worked on the card "Create class diagram for the drinks"

## Week #2 Status Report

## Week #3 Status Report

* This week I worked on developing the cashier's app part of the project. I created it using spring and successfully created a simple application that can be used by the cashier. The only thing i need to do is update the application UI so that it can be used on a rectangular/square screen that are used by cashiers. We also need to connect the backend to the cashier's app.

* Our group met this week to talk about our progress and coordinate when we should have the project ready to go and when we will meet to create the video that we will submit.
