### Accomplishments

This was the first week that our team had a meeting. I volunteered to push my Starbucks API to the repository as the starting point for our project. I also have started thinking about the UI.

### Challenges and Resolutions

The main challenge this week was understanding the requirements of the project. It usually takes me a bit of time to wrap my head around the many different aspects of an application I am about to build, and this project is heavy on the architectural/integration side of things. I plan to create a few UI mockups just to help us get started with our design.
