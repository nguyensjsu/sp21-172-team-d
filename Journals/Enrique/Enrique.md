# CMPE 172 Project Journal - Rusty Pedrosa (Enrique)

## Week 3
- Since I just finished lab 8, I want to see if I can keep it online and point a domain to my kong ingress IP for our project.
  - I already own a domain, pedrosatech.com, so let's see if I can get a subdomain going
  - The domain is registered through namecheap, but I just have it redirecting to some nsone DNS server.
  - Finally remembered that my DNS settings / webhosting are at Netlify now.. I set them up a while ago so I could have something at my domain.  It just points to a github repo without much content.

  - Turns out it is an easy process to change a GCP external IP to a static address - there's just a dropdown.

- That was a bit off-topic though.  I need to focus on getting pricing and rewards working in the back end in the next couple days, since I was too busy this week.

## Week 2
- Started investigating Stripe as an alternative to CyberSource

## Week 1
- Missed our first group meeting due to a midterm timing conflict. Team brought me up to speed in group chat.
- Team already has laid out the first few tasks, so I will be getting started next week.
